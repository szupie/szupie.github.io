				<p><i>This work is from my role as an experience designer at an advertising agency</i></p>

				<p>In this project, I reimagined the app homescreen for an investment management service, looking for ways to promote the suite of tools offered. The concept design encourages users to take control of their investments via contextual and personalised action recommendations.</p>


				<h3 id="Ecosystem_mapping">Ecosystem mapping</h3>

				<p>I started with research on the company’s ecosystem of investment tools and services. Like many companies with an established history, the product organisation was influenced by company structure, and reorganisation based on relevant user needs would improve discoverability.</p>

					<img src="assets/ecosystem-mapping.png" alt="Screenshots of the many tools in the ecosystem" class="key-figure"/>
					<figcaption>In the research phase, I catalogued the services offered and reorganised them according to different user needs to identify the relevant contexts for surfacing each product</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3 id="Dashboard_concept">Dashboard concept</h3>

				<p>Based on the research, I designed an app homescreen concept organised by user intents, starting from the most common and basic and advancing to more involved actions:</p>

				<ul class="body-list">
					<li>Monitor their portfolio</li>
					<li>Update their portfolio with recommended actions</li>
					<li>Invest in new funds</li>
					<li>Research larger market trends</li>
				</ul>

						<img src="assets/dashboard-1-monitor.png" alt="Historic performance chart of portfolio" class="key-figure vertical" style="--ideal-span: 4"/>
						<figcaption>
							<h4>Monitor</h4>
							<p><em>Track portfolio’s recent performance</em></p>
							<p>The initial view provides the most important information about the user’s portfolio, like current total and recent changes. Those looking for more can interact with the chart or dive into more detailed breakdowns.</p>

						<img src="assets/dashboard-2-update.png" alt="Recommended actions arranged in tiles" class="key-figure vertical" style="--ideal-span: 4"/>
						<figcaption>
							<h4>Update</h4>
							<p><em>Recommended actions to improve portfolio</em></p>
							<p>Actions can be accompanied by an explanation of why it was recommended, providing more context to help drive users to other tools in the product suite.</p>
							<h5>Example triggers</h5>
							<ul class="body-list">
								<li>New investments: recommend reallocation, recurring investments, etc.</li>
								<li>Profile updates: recommend college saving, investment advice, etc.</li>
								<li>Periodic reminder: recommend retirement plan, etc.</li>
							</ul>

					</figure>

						<img src="assets/dashboard-3-invest.png" alt="Cards of recommended funds" class="key-figure vertical" style="--ideal-span: 4"/>
						<figcaption>
							<h4>Invest</h4>
							<p><em>Personalised investment recommendations</em></p>
							<p>Key snippets pulled from their mutual fund research tool, providing a directed entry to more detailed research.</p>
							<h5>Key metrics</h5>
							<ul class="body-list">
								<li>Total Return Value</li>
								<li>Historical performance</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Research</h4>
							<p><em>Recommended articles based on selected interests</em></p>
							<p>The company also publishes articles that educate users on larger market trends and investment strategies.</p>
