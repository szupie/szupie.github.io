				<p>As a dinosaur enthusiast since childhood, I had read a lot about Earth’s history. I was familiar with the different geological periods, past supercontinents, and the evolution of different branches of life. However, I had rarely seen them together in a single timeline, starting from the formation of Earth. I decided to build a tool to show the evolution of life and the continents in context of each other.</p>

				<p><a href="https://dinosaurpictures.org/ancient-earth">Ancient Earth</a> is a similar tool, but I wanted to show more frequent snapshots in time and make it easy to navigate between different them. I also wanted to provide more context on the significance of each event.</p>

				<p>This was a personal project that combined my skills in interaction design, <abbr>UI</abbr> design, coding, and many hours of research and writing.</p>

				<h3 id="Concept_sketches">Concept sketches</h3>

				<p>The key features I wanted include were:</p>

				<ul class="body-list">
					<li>An interactive map of past continent positions</li>
					<li>The ability to quickly scrub through different points in time</li>
					<li>Timeline of major evolutionary and geological events shown in the same context</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I started with some sketches to get a sense of how much information can fit on the screen.</p>

				<h3 id="Design_direction">Design direction</h3>

				<p>Since the main focus was visualising the movement of the continents, I went with a style that would pay homage to Alfred Wegener’s paper proposing the idea of continental drift. I gathered publications from the era and took inspiration from their treatment of type in different contexts, from body to display to labels.</p>

The nonhumanist vertical axis of the letterforms allude to the rejection of human qualities</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</figure>

				<p>I also looked at contemporary industrial design to study their design elements. One major difference was the physicality of controls, which are often large levers or buttons with substantial travel distance. This was a necessity given the mechanical nature of products from the era, but it also had the benefit of clearly signifying to the user how they can interact with the interface.</p>

				</figure>


				<h3 id="Accessible_colour_palette">Accessible colour palette</h3>

				<p>Products from the era often used a black and gold colour scheme. Black was a common base colour, which works well in this tool for representing the dark background of space. Gold was a popular accent colour, which I reserved for consistently indicating interactive elements. I also included brown in the colour palette, to be used only in association with geological elements. Gold is a difficult colour to emulate on screen, and works much better when used in contrast with the brown.</p>

				<p>Given the complexity of the <abbr>UI</abbr>, it was helpful to have a large palette of colours to create visual separation as well as relationships between the different elements. To ensure sufficient contrast, I used <a href="https://huetone.ardov.me/">Huetone</a> to select a gamette of shades for each hue. The tool helps calculate contrast values between every swatch pairing. It supports the proposed <abbr title="Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm">APCA</abbr> specification, which is designed to fix some of the flaws in the current <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> contrast algorithm.</p>

				<h3 id="Interactive_map_for_better_understanding">Interactive map for better understanding</h3>

				<p>Books and research papers are usually limited to showing flat, static maps. Unfortunately, all <abbr>2D</abbr> projections of the globe inherently suffer from distortions of sizes and distances, especially at the edges. I decided to present the maps in the familiar format of a physical, spinnable globe, so that the distortions are more intuitive for users to understand.</p>

				<p>One main disadvantage of this orthographic projection is the limited view to one hemisphere at a time. With so many continental plates drifting around in different directions in the vast oceans, users could easily get lost trying to figure out where to turn the globe. I implemented two ways to orient users to land: auto-rotating to each supercontinent, or tracking the movements of specific continents.</p>

					</figure>
				</figure>


				<h3 id="Custom_map_design">Custom map design</h3>

				<p>Scotese’s raster maps go as far back as 750 million years ago. For the older reconstructions, I had to create a custom map design to maintain a consistent look and feel between different sources. I generated the maps based on Euler rotations data published in the latest research papers. They specify the displacement of each continental plate, some in terms of nested rotations relative to other moving plates. To convert them into mappable data, I created a custom tool for calculating the chained rotations.</p>

					<figcaption>Present-day country borders help users understand the orientations of the ancient continents.</figcaption>
				</figure>


				<h3 id="Globe_implementation">Globe implementation</h3>

				<p>I implemented the globe using a combination of D3.js and WebGL. D3 is a well-established data visualisation library with a module for handling spherical geometry, but I needed to use a WebGL shader to render the roughly 100 raster maps efficiently, without slowing down the page scroll. To further improve performance, I implemented update throttling and low-resolution pre-renders.</p>

				<p>I also developed custom globe rotation controls that have the tactility of spinning a real globe. Most globe implementations on the web translate user movements to rotations at a constant rate. This makes drags near the poles drift significantly from the contact point on the globe, due to the different tangential speeds at different distances from the rotational axis. For this implementation, I developed a custom algorithm to ensure the cursor stays at the same point on the globe while dragging.</p>

				<h3 id="Research_data_visualisation_design">Research & data visualisation design</h3>

				<p>The most time-consuming aspect of this project was the research and writing. Evidence for early events are harder to find, leading to inconsistent timelines between different interpretations of data. In order to construct a cohesive narrative, I had to read through many research papers and reference only a select few.</p>

				<p>Showing all of Earth’s history in one timeline proved to be a design challenge. Evidence of complex multicellular life only dates back to the most recent fifth of Earth’s history, while fossil evidence of prior life is significantly scarcer. To avoid crowding the history of all plants and animals in a small sliver of the timeline, many textbooks use a logarithmic scale that compresses timespans the further back in time you go. However, I wanted to show time on a linear scale, since it is much easier for humans to comprehend. I decided to use a magnified timeline for the most recent events before zooming out to clearly show its scale relative to the entire history of Earth.</p>
